      <h2> All about my insights of Yellowjackets </h2>
      <h5>Why am I interested in this show? August 15, 2025</h5>
      <img src="yellowkackets-s1-cover.jpg" style="height:225px;"></div>
      <p>Why do I think "Yellowjackets" is so good? What about it that intrigues me so much? what even is it about?</p>
      <p>In 1996, a high school girl's football team found themselves stranded in the wilderness after a plane crash. Their fight for survival plunges them into an eerie void. At first, they are victims of fate, but something begins to shift as they push further into the darkness. It's not just nature that threatens them, there’s something far more sinister lurking, something ancient and malevolent, creeping beneath the surface. As time goes on, survival becomes less about staying alive and more about keeping something else buried. The further they go, the less they recognise themselves, and each other. 

Shauna, in particular, embodies this descent. Her duality, loyal friend versus secret-keeper, survivor versus destroyer, anchors the psychological tension of the series. Her choices, both as a teen and in the present day, blur the line between guilt and instinct, making her a fascinating lens through which we watch the group’s unraveling. It’s her quiet intensity and moral ambiguity that keeps the audience hooked, wondering: how far would we go? 

Twenty-five years later the survivors have returned to a world they thought they knew. But their memories are like ghosts, following them in every room, in every conversation. They can run, but the darkness will always follow. 

But the past doesn’t forget. It’s waiting for them to remember. </p>

      <h2>The Genre</h2>
      <h5>Psychological Horror</h5>
      <img src="coolyjspic.jpg" style="height:230px;"></div>
      <p>One of the reasons I myself find this particular series interesting is because my taste in shows and films are the horror and psychological genre, considering that it is  a mix of both or either both— really hooks me on. Now, scarred and broken, they carry more than just physical wounds; they carry secrets. Secrets that, if exposed, could destroy them all. Yellowjackets isn’t merely about survival. It’s about the kind of survival that twists you, that changes you in ways you never thought possible. The women at the centre of this story are haunted not just by what happened, but by what they did to survive. Each of them is a puzzle, their pasts fractured, their identities slipping away, Piece by piece. No one emerges unscathed. The question is: who are they now? 

Yellowjackets is a slow unravelling of something far darker, something that can’t be put back together once it’s torn apart. It’s a web of secrets, a mystery wrapped in shadows, where the answers are never simple, and the danger is never far away. With every episode, you’ll find yourself drawn further into a world where nothing is as it seems, and the past, no matter how far back you run, always catches up.</p>

There’s something about watching this show late at night, in the quiet darkness, that makes it all the more unsettling. The silence amplifies the tension, every creak and shadow in your room mirroring the dread that crawls through the screen. As you get lost in the twists and turns, you may find yourself questioning, whether you should have left the lights on after all.</p>
